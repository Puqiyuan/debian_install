The instruction is from:
    http://cs2.swfu.edu.cn/~wx672/lecture_notes/linux/install.html


1, first, you need to download a install file:
   http://mirrors.163.com/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/
   download the file that end with netinst.iso

2, then insert your USB, now we are ready to make live USB by the downloaded file,
   on Debian it's easy:
   sudo cp debian-x.x,x-amd-netinst.iso	/dev/sdX
   sudo sync
   change the X to the char that you find by the command:
   sudo fdisk -l
   x.x.x is number that you download version number.

3, now reboot your machine and press F12 for Lenovo then select boot from USB.

4, DO NOT insert your net wire, Select "Install", select "English", select "Hong Kong",
   "American English", get a beautiful host name for your Debian system, say sun. no
   domain name, and root, user, password and all that.

5, After some waiting, we now consider partition, for example of my machine, there is
   a 500GB disk. 200GB for a Debian, so 300GB free, now I give my new Debian, sun to 100
   GB, SELECT 297.1GB, I will partition this disk, I must every care because there already
   a Debian. Then Create a new partition, 100GB, And mount point is /.

6, Then waiting installing the base system. And select mirror source, in China, it be
   better 163 source. When configure may need network, but after that we need to unplug
   the network, because we just need to install a base system. Select install software,
   but only select standard system utilities and print server, we don't need a desktop.
   There need network.

7,
